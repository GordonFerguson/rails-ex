The PRC database of people, productions and seasons
============================

The Playmakers Repetory Company celebrated in 40th anniversay a couple of
years ago. One part of that was assembling a database of program data going 
back to the original season. The database has been sufficiently useful that
we are continuing to maintain it. It has been renamed PrcPps from PrcIs40
and web hosting is now provided by UNC Carolina Cloud Apps project. This is
the git repository CCA uses to build PrcPps.
